# How to run?
First of all you need to downolad packages
```
npm install
```
To run the application, you will first need to start the **json-server on port 4000**
```
json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
```
Once the server is running, you can then start the application by running the command
```
npm start
```
**Make sure that you are in the correct directory when running these commands.**

# File Structure
All files are located in the **/src** folder

## /axios
This folder contains Axios instances. You can change the port of the **JSON-server** in the **axios_pokemons.ts** file\
\
To change port you can replace ***":4000"*** with any other port number you want. For example, if you want to use port 5000, you can update the **baseURL** as follows:
```
const instance = axios.create({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:5000
})
```
Make sure that the **json-server** is also running on the same port
